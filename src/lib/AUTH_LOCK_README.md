# Supabase Auth Lock Fix

## Issue Description

The error `_loadSession() used outside of an acquired lock` occurs when multiple concurrent Supabase auth operations try to access the session state simultaneously. This is a race condition in the Supabase client library that can happen when:

1. Multiple components are checking auth state at the same time
2. Auth operations are triggered during rapid navigation
3. Event listeners fire simultaneously

## Solution Implemented

This enhanced authentication lock management system:

1. Ensures that only one auth operation runs at a time
2. Queues additional operations to run sequentially
3. Provides safe wrappers around common auth operations
4. Includes automatic exponential backoff retries for failed operations
5. Auto-recovers from deadlocks with timeout detection
6. Provides detailed error handling with user-friendly messages

## How to Use the Lock Management System

Instead of calling Supabase auth methods directly, use the safe wrappers:

```typescript
// Instead of this:
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession();

// Use this:
const { data, error } = await getSessionSafely();
```

The safe wrappers include:

- `getSessionSafely()` - Get the current session 
- `getUserSafely()` - Get the current user
- `signOutSafely()` - Sign out the user
- `signInWithEmailSafely()` - Sign in with email/password
- `signUpSafely()` - Sign up a new user
- `withAuthLock(() => {...}, 'operationName')` - Wrap custom auth operations in a lock

## Error Handling

The system includes improved error handling with:

1. Automatic retries for lock-related errors
2. Exponential backoff between retry attempts
3. User-friendly error messages for common auth issues
4. Detailed logging for debugging

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

Monitor the auth lock system with:

```typescript
import { getAuthLockStatus } from './lib/auth-lock-fix';

// Get current system status
const status = getAuthLockStatus();
console.log('Auth lock status:', status);
```

The status object provides:
- `isLocked`: Whether a lock is currently held
- `lockHolder`: Name of the operation holding the lock
- `queueLength`: Number of operations waiting
- `lockHeldDuration`: How long the current lock has been held (ms)

## Emergency Recovery

If you still experience auth lock issues, you can use:

```typescript
import { emergencySessionReset } from './lib/auth-lock-fix';

// In an error handler or recovery function:
emergencySessionReset();
```

## Manual Reset

You can also add a reset URL parameter to your application. Just navigate to:

```
https://your-app.com?logout=true
```

This will clear all auth tokens and reset the session state.

## Technical Details

The lock system includes these advanced features:

- Automatic timeout recovery for locks held too long (5 seconds)
- Queue timeout to prevent operations from being stuck in queue
- Sequential operation processing with priority handling
- Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Detailed operation tracking and diagnostics
