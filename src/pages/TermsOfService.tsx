              Welcome to Akii ("Company", "we", "our", "us"). These Terms of
              Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") govern your use of our
              website and AI instance platform (collectively, the "Service")
              operated by Akii.
            </p>

              By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these

              When you create an account with us, you must provide information
              that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to
              do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in
              immediate termination of your account on our Service.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
              ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring
              and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a
              monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription
              plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
              automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you
              cancel it or Akii cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
              renewal either through your online account management page or by
              contacting Akii customer support.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Our Service allows you to launch and train private AI Instances using your 
              proprietary data and deploy them across various supported platforms.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              You retain full ownership of your training data and any content you provide. 
              By uploading content, you grant Akii a non-exclusive, royalty-free license 
              to use your data solely for the purpose of delivering and maintaining the 
              Service on your behalf.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Akii integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS), including Amazon Bedrock, 
              to provide model inference, fine-tuning, and related AI capabilities. AWS 
              does not retain or use any customer data for model training, and your AI 
              usage is routed through stateless, ephemeral infrastructure with no long-term 
              data retention.
            </p>

              with applicable laws, including privacy, copyright, and intellectual property 
              regulations. You must not use our Service to upload, generate, or distribute 
              content that violates legal or ethical standards.

            </h2>

              We employ automated and manual content moderation systems to prevent misuse of our
              Service. You agree not to use the Service to generate or
              distribute content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive,
              harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive of
              another's privacy, or otherwise objectionable.

              We reserve the right to review and moderate any content generated
              through our Service and to take appropriate action, including
              removing content or suspending accounts, if we determine, in our
              sole discretion, that such content violates these Terms or
              applicable laws.
