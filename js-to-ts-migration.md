# JavaScript to TypeScript Migration Log

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating JavaScript (.js) files to TypeScript (.tsx/.ts) in the Akii project.

## Migration Status

| Date | File | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 2023-10-30 | src/App.js → src/App.tsx | Complete | TypeScript version already exists and is in use |
| 2023-10-30 | src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.js → src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx | Complete | TypeScript version already exists and is maintained |
| 2023-10-30 | src/pages/dashboard/UserDetails.tsx | N/A | Route removed from App.js as it's no longer needed |

## Changes Made

### 2023-10-30
- Removed the user-details route from src/App.js
- Removed the UserDetails import from src/App.js
- Confirmed TypeScript version of App.tsx doesn't include the user-details route
- Confirmed both Sidebar.js and Sidebar.tsx don't include a link to user-details

## Files That Need Migration
- src/App.js → Should be aligned with src/App.tsx and eventually removed
- src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.js → Should be aligned with src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx and eventually removed
- All other .js files that have .tsx/.ts equivalents should be identified and migrated

## Migration Strategy
1. Identify JavaScript files that have TypeScript equivalents
2. Ensure TypeScript versions are complete and up-to-date
3. Update application imports to reference TypeScript files instead of JavaScript
4. Remove JavaScript files once they're no longer referenced

## Next Steps
1. Complete an audit of all JS files in the codebase
2. Determine which JS files have TS counterparts and which need to be migrated
3. Create a prioritized list of files to migrate
4. Begin systematic migration of high-priority files
